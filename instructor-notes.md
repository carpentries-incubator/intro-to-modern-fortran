## Learner Profiles

Before teaching a workshop consider who is attending and their needs. This section highlights audiences for this Fortran course. Instructors can use the profiles to decide which episodes to teach or place more emphasis on.

**_Tahani is a new research software engineer at the Met Office._** She has just joined the office after their degree and have experience in Python, Linux, and shell commands. She has limited experience with compiled languages. The weather and climate code she will be working on is written in Fortran. She thought Fortran was a dead language.

**_Ionas, a researcher joining the JULES (Joint UK Land Environment Simulator) partnership._** They will be adding new functionality to JULES in Fortran. They have extensive experience with C and C++ and have been told there are differences between Fortran and C/C++ that they should be aware of. They are keen to learn Fortran but must fit their learning inbetween teaching duties and other research commitments.

**_Malak is mathematics graduate student working on new timestepping methods._** Malaks previous work was mostly theoretical although he knows basic Python. Malak needs to use Fortran to prototype his new routines which will interface with other Fortran code. Malak has been told by his supervisor that he should set up his preferred text editor for Fortran development.

**_Joe has been employed by a tech company to update their Fortran code._** Joe has years of experience developing mainly C++ code for HPCs but has not used Fortran in a production environment. They have been asked to update legacy code to modern standards, including implementing some form of testing and using standard libraries. Joe is not sure if there is a standard code style that they can adopt.
